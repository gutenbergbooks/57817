<p><i><b><span class="xlarge">O</span></b>n September 28, 1761, a year after France&rsquo;s vast North
American empire had been surrendered to the British at
Montreal, Canada, the flag of Great Britain was raised over
Fort Michilimackinac, far to the west at what is now Mackinaw
City, Michigan. A force under Major Robert Rogers,
leader of the almost legendary Rogers&rsquo; Rangers, had reached
Detroit in 1760 and had taken control of that post, but the
coming of winter had compelled the British to wait until the
following year to take over the other French outposts in the
upper Great Lakes.</i></p>
<p><i>Although Major Rogers later was to serve as commanding
officer at Michilimackinac, the red-coated troops who marched
into the little stockaded fort on the south shore of the straits
connecting Lake Huron and Lake Michigan were commanded
by Captain Henry Balfour. He found that the French garrison
had departed for the west months before, leaving the
fort in charge of Charles Langlade, a native of the area who
had fought brilliantly on the French side during the French
and Indian War. Balfour was greeted by several enterprising
Englishmen who had gotten a head start in the race to gain
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
control of the lucrative fur trade which for so long had been
monopolized by French traders at Michilimackinac.</i></p>
<p><i>After accepting the fort&rsquo;s formal surrender and before
leaving for the west, Balfour detailed a small force from the
famous Royal American or 60th Regiment to remain as the
garrison. Two years later, during the great Indian uprising
of 1763, fierce Chippewa warriors massacred over half of
the soldiers and temporarily drove the British out. But within
a year they returned in greater numbers, and from then until
1781, when it was abandoned for a new, more easily defended
post on Mackinac Island, Fort Michilimackinac was one of the
key links in the chain of military and trading posts which
Great Britain maintained on the western frontier of its American
colonies.</i></p>
<p><i>Among those who came to the fort in the late 1760&rsquo;s was
a Scotsman, Daniel Morison, surgeon&rsquo;s mate in the Royal
Americans&rsquo; Second Battalion. Of his life before and after
his tour of duty at Fort Michilimackinac we know nothing.
Under ordinary circumstances we would agree with one of
Morison&rsquo;s commanding officers who told him bluntly, &ldquo;You
are not worth my Notice.&rdquo; But Morison is worth our attention
because between 1769 and 1772 he kept a journal in which
he set down in language that is often unintentionally hilarious
and at other times brutally frank the best account that we

<p><i>This important historical document, now published for
the first time in its entirety, was purchased in 1914 by the
great collector of materials relating to the history of Michigan
and the Old Northwest, Clarence M. Burton, who bought
it from a book seller in London, England, for $55. He
brought the journal back to the state in which it was written
where it now rests in the Burton Historical Collection of the
Detroit Public Library.</i></p>
<p><i>Dr. Morison&rsquo;s journal provides us with a picture of the
English population of the fort, a people beset by violence,
lawlessness, tyrannical officers, petty bickering, and assorted
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
other problems. A reading of the journal should dispel any
romantic notions of what conditions were like at an
eighteenth-century frontier fort.</i></p>
<p><i>The inhabitants of Michilimackinac consisted of several
groups. There were the soldiers, numbering around a hundred
men. A few of them, we learn from Morison, had brought
out their wives. The commanding officer&rsquo;s house was the most
impressive of the thirty-odd wooden buildings located within
the stockade. The other officers lived in various cabins in the
fort, as did the rank and file of the troops until 1769 when a
large barracks was constructed in the center of the fort. Dr.
Morison&rsquo;s complaints about the poor quality of the housing
are supported by statements of others who commented on the
ramshackle construction which necessitated constant repairs
and made the danger of fire an ever-present fear.</i></p>
<p><i>As a military fort Michilimackinac was scarcely adequate
even to withstand the attacks of Indians. The post was maintained,
however, because it was a convenient center of the
fur trade. The small garrison, with its six-pound and nine-pound
cannon mounted on the bastions, was enough to impress
the Indians who lived in the vicinity and those who
gathered here each summer with the reality of British armed
might. This symbol of military power protected the English
fur traders who made up the second, and most important,
segment of the fort&rsquo;s population.</i></p>
<p><i>By 1767 Michilimackinac had become for the British as
it had been for the French the headquarters for the fur trade
of a fourth of the continent. Canoes were sent out from here
loaded with trade goods to be exchanged for furs at distant
Indian villages located in the uncharted wilderness north
and west of Lake Superior, westward across the Mississippi,
and southward to the Illinois country. For two or three
months in the summer hundreds of <span class="f">voyageurs</span> and traders
came back from the west, bringing in the furs they had
gathered during the previous year or two. Like the lumberjacks
of a later era, these men were bent on enjoying to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
fullest degree their brief contact with the comforts of civilization
before they returned to the west to barter for more furs.</i></p>
<p><i>A few traders who had acquired sufficient means to enable
them to hire others to do the actual trading remained here
the year round and occupied cabins in the fort. These Michilimackinac
traders, men like Benjamin Frobisher, Isaac Todd,
George McBeath, and others not mentioned by Morison, together
with their agents or partners in Montreal who obtained
the trade goods and sold the furs, dominated the fur
trade for decades.</i></p>
<p><i>From Morison&rsquo;s narrative we see that the officers and the
traders permanently in residence at the fort formed an elite
group. It is obvious that the French <span class="f">habitants</span> and half-breeds
who comprised a third part of the fort&rsquo;s population, not to
mention the Indians of the area, were not admitted to this
exclusive social club. That the strain of being cooped up in
the small fort, cut off from all contact with the outside world
for over half the year, proved too much for some of the members
of this clique, especially the bachelors, is also obvious.</i></p>
<p><i>Equally apparent is the fact that Dr. Morison, poor man,
was unsuited to withstand the rigors of life at this post. He
was apparently an educated man who could quote accurately
from Virgil&rsquo;s <span class="f">Aeneid</span>, and a man of refinement and sensitivity.
To some of the cruder members of the English set he must
have seemed an easy target and a source of amusement when
life became too dull and the bowls of toddy ran dry. Feeling
himself much persecuted, as he certainly was, and outraged
by the injustices of which he and others were the victims,
Dr. Morison fumed, but, with a few exceptions, as when he
refused to permit the whipping of a soldier to continue, he
lacked the courage necessary to stand up to his oppressors.
So, like Lieutenant Maryk in <span class="f">The Caine Mutiny</span>, who kept a
secret log on the activities of his sick captain, Dr. Morison
recorded in his journal the evidence which he no doubt hoped
would some day enable him to bring Ensign Robert Johnson,
Captain George Turnbull, and his other tormentors to justice.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p><i>Actually, Dr. Morison probably was not a doctor at all.
He was a surgeon&rsquo;s mate, which means that he may once
have been an apprentice to a surgeon and that he may have
taken a course or two at a medical school but that it is unlikely
he ever graduated since had he done so he would not
have been simply a mate. The professional ability of the
British army surgeon&rsquo;s mate was of a notoriously low order,
and, if we may believe one of the Royal Americans&rsquo; regimental
surgeons, Daniel Morison was no exception in this
respect. Surgeons were scarce, however, and a small frontier
garrison, even when, as at Michilimackinac, it had been
plagued by much sickness, had to be satisfied with the services
of a mate. Unlike the surgeon, who was commissioned
by the king, the surgeon&rsquo;s mate was only a warrant officer
appointed by the colonel of the regiment. The mate, therefore,
was inferior in rank even to the ensign, the lowest of the
commissioned officers. This was undoubtedly the source of
many of Morison&rsquo;s problems. He claimed the title of doctor
and demanded equal status with the officers, who, for their
part, treated him as they would a common soldier.</i></p>
<p><i>Comments added at the end of the manuscript in a different
handwriting indicate that someone in England who
possessed Morison&rsquo;s journal in the nineteenth century intended
to publish it in a magazine. No evidence has been
found that this was done. In preparing the journal for publication
we have ignored the numerous changes that this
earlier editor made in the document and have retained
Morison&rsquo;s own phraseology at all times, including the misspelled
words and grammatical construction so typical of his
age. The narrative has been broken into five parts, and
paragraphing and punctuation has been supplied at some
places in the interest of easier reading. Material within
brackets has been inserted by the present editor.</i></p>

<p><i><b><span class="xlarge">D</span></b>r. Morison begins his journal innocently enough with
an account of a party which he and others gave in the fall
of 1769. Among the other hosts was Isaac Todd, who later
helped found the great Canadian fur-trading firm, the North
West Company, and whose long-time partner, James McGill,
endowed McGill University in Montreal. The party began
to get out of hand with the arrival of a couple of rowdy
traders&mdash;John Chinn, who is best remembered as a partner
in an unsuccessful copper-mining venture in Michigan&rsquo;s Upper
Peninsula, and Forrest Oaks, who was a prominent fur
trader at Michilimackinac and later at Montreal for a number
of years after 1769.</i></p>
<p><i>Morison, who seems to have been something of a name-dropper,
mentions as he goes along other men who are familiar
to students of the fur trade and British military history.
But all of them are dwarfed by Ensign Robert Johnson, who
crashed Morison&rsquo;s party and soon turned the evening into
a nightmare. Johnson (which is apparently how he spelled
his name, although Morison insists on calling him Johnstone)
is the villain of Morison&rsquo;s journal, a scoundrel and bully
whom we come almost to admire for the infinite variety of
ways in which he gave vent to his evil nature.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p><i>He had been deeply involved in the Robert Rogers affair
which had rocked the little community at Michilimackinac
two years before. Johnson was in Detroit in the fall of 1767
where he had gone for the treatment of an injury when a
messenger from British military headquarters for North America
arrived with orders to place Major Rogers, commandant
at Michilimackinac, under arrest on suspicion of treason.
Johnson brought these orders back to the Straits, and it was
Lieutenant John Christie, an officer who also figures prominently
in Morison&rsquo;s journal, who arrested Rogers. Johnson
later asked to be given charge of the detail that took Rogers
to Montreal for trial, boasting that he would foil any attempt
that might be made to set Rogers free. However, when
Rogers was acquitted, those who had hoped to see him convicted
charged that the prosecution&rsquo;s case had been fatally
weakened by Johnson&rsquo;s testimony which had enabled the
defense to show that Rogers had been mistreated while he
was a prisoner. Such mistreatment would be in keeping with
the picture of Johnson&rsquo;s character which emerges from a
reading of Dr. Morison&rsquo;s journal.</i></p>
<p class="tb"><b><span class="xlarge">N</span></b>arrative of an Action of Burglary and felony perpetrated
on the Dwelling House &amp; person of Daniel Morison,
Surgeon&rsquo;s mate of the 2d. Battn. 60th Regt. at Michilamackinac
the Seventh day of November (about 5 Oclock in the
morning) in the Year one thousand seven hundred &amp; sixty
nine, Vizt:</p>
<p>That the evening before being the sixth of November,
Isaac Todd, merchant, William Maxwell, commissary of provisions
&amp; I proposed to give an Entertainment at Sergt.
[Thomas] MacMurrays to which we Severally invited such
people as we thought (in such a remote corner) qualified
to make the evening pass agreeably. Accordingly we met,
and everything was carryed on with the greatest Decency &amp;
innocent Mirth till John Chinn &amp; Forrest Oaks, traders,
joined us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>After drinking a glass round, John Chinn (who appeared
to be the worse of liquor) before &amp; at supper began to be
troublesome, opened upon me with Volleys of ragged raillery
(without the least provocation on my side) and that blended
with Opprobrious Expressions, namely, that I was an officer
in the Rebellion &amp;c. in the Year 1745 [the abortive Scottish
attempt to place Bonnie Prince Charlie on the British throne],
which tho&rsquo; I knew was an arrant untruth, did not think it
prudent to make the proper answer his wrongious Assertions
deserved, [but] waved it off in the smoothest manner, lest
the Company should be disturbed. Notwithstanding, our
merriment was in a great measure unhinged, as the said
John Chinn&rsquo;s only pleasure consisted chiefly in being officious,
by hobb or nobbing with everyone [who] would chuse to
drink with him, &amp; indeed importunely pouring perpetually
in upon those who did not chuse to drink more than would
do them good.</p>
<p>About the hour of eleven o&rsquo;clock, Ens. Robert Johnstone
(who for ought I know invited himself) came in, accompanied
by Ens. John Strickland &amp; Mr. [George] Main. We
continued thus till about one O&rsquo;clock in the morning, when
Numbers of our Company thought proper to retire. I proposed
retiring also, but Isaac Todd insisted upon my spending
one hour or two more with them. Rather than disoblige I
consented.</p>
<p>About half one hour after, Ens. Johnstone asked the Company
how their punch pleased them. They answered, well
enough. Then he, the said Ens. Johnstone, blabbed out publickly,
Vauntingly &amp; wantonly, he had mingled four ounces
of Jallap [a purgative] with the water that was a boiling
for proportioning the Punch &amp; Sangary [wine spiced and
diluted with water]. This giddy Declaration, instead of meeting
with approbation, occasioned the interjection of one universal
sneer. I said nothing tho&rsquo; I perfectly knew such irregular
proceedings could not be intended for good. Therefore I
silently winked over it, as others did; at the same time took
particular notice that Ens. Johnstone drank nothing but wine
all the night over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>John Chinn and Forrest Oaks, who left the Company
about one o&rsquo;clock, seemingly fuddled, returned to the charge
one hour &amp; one half thereafter. The abovesaid John Chinn
appeared to be as unruly as ever. In short, conversation became
very insipid. Drinking was the principal amusement,
varnished over with various inconsistencys. At length time
dragged on very heavily. Consequently [I] excused myself
to be away, pleading the part I had to act in regard to my
department. Upon which John Chinn swore by a bloody
Oath he would come with a Hatchet and pull down my house,
if I did not stay a little longer. To palliate this foolish menace,
I thought it prudent to humour, [rather] than exasperate
[him] on that Occasion.</p>
<p>[I] continued in [his] company till about four o&rsquo;clock,
then sheered off quietly not imagineing he would persist in
his folly. [I] went to bed without dread or fear, as I gave
no other plausible offense except what my absence suggested
to them. But the Sequel will evidently discover the Maliciousness
of their perverse intentions, for about five o&rsquo;clock in
the morning the seventh of November abovesaid, the door
of my house was forcibly broke open, one plank of the Door-leaf,
bars, bolt &amp;c. pulled down to the floor. Upon entering
my Room they also broke down my stove which was strongly
made of bricks, clay &amp; lime. This unwarrantable deed was
principally perpetrated by Ens. Robert Johnstone of the
2d Battn. &amp; Oaks the trader.</p>
<p>So fast was I asleep [that I] knew nothing of these violent
proceedings untill Oaks Surprized me out of a profound sleep,
tumbling in roughly in my bed [and] bawling loudly, &ldquo;Doctor,
Doctor, damn your blood, get up &amp; give us a bowl of
Toddy, other wise You&rsquo;ll repent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wakened as out of a dream. He, the said Oaks&rsquo; next
question was if I had my durk by my bed-side. I answered,
&ldquo;Never in time of peace.&rdquo; Upon this I called to my servant
John Forbes to light a candle, which was no sooner done, &amp;
set upon the table at my bed side after my servant retired
to the kitchen, then the said Ens. Johnstone kicked down &amp;
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
overturned the table, candle, candlestick, &amp;c., topsy turvy
in great wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this You, Ens. Johnstone,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;who behaves so
rudely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I am a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made answer that his rude behavior betrayed the contrary
in the eyes of good men.</p>
<p>Then he swore bloodily in the height of Rage, he would
shew me that he was a gentleman &amp; immediately fell upon,
attacked &amp; pelted me violently in my naked bed, he &amp; his
abbettor Oaks. The room being dark all my attempts of defence
were rendered ineffectual by Oaks&rsquo;s exerting his outmost
strength to entangle me in my sheets &amp; bed-Cloathes out
of which I struggled to extricate myself like a fish entangled
in a net. They pelted me pell-mell with incessant blows repeatedly,
on the face, left breast, &amp;c., to the Effusion of my
blood. Before I could recover myself out of the jeopardy into
which I was involved, my shirt, sheets &amp; pillowcase [were]
all bespattered with gore &amp; blood in my naked bed untill
Sergt. McMurray &amp; Arthur Ross, soldier, with the assistance
of my servant, John Forbes, turned them out of the Room.
Otherwise it is [hard] to know where the consequences would
end. William Maxwell, the Commissary, &amp; Christian Burgy,
trader, came in who saw my face bruised all over, besmeared
[with] Blood.</p>
<p>In the meantime Forrest Oaks had the impudence to come
back again, &amp; upon a rehearsal of my bad useage, very unmannerly
gave me the ly twice or thrice, in my own house.
To this Sergt. MacMurray, Mr. Maxwell &amp; the abovesaid
Christian Burgy was present, who can testify in this, as well
as other Circumstances. I imagined he intended this insult
as a provocation to stirr me up to do something rash, of which
he might make a handle to invalidate my pretensions to
Justice on account of his being accessory to the violent attack
upon my person as abovesaid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Whether there were more accomplices [who] acted in
conjunction with Ens. Johnstone &amp; Forrest Oaks at the breakeing
of my house &amp;c., I cannot positively determine (the room
being dark) except what may be inferred from a chain of
Circumstances. For John Chinn (whose mind it seems was
so replete with the dregs of his former menaces abovesaid,
as if he intended to make his menace good) he, the said John
Chinn, was met by Isaac Todd on his way to my house, with
a great Hatchet in his hand. Mr. Todd asked where he was
going. The said John Chinn answered, to break down the
Doctor&rsquo;s house. Upon which Mr. Todd, partly by persuasion,
&amp; partly by dint of strength, brought him home to his lodgeing.</p>
<p>Whether it was before this, or after, I cannot say, my
servant John Forbes catched the said John Chinn at the
porch before my broken door, with a large Hatchet, while
the assailants abovesaid, to wit, Ens. Johnstone &amp; Oaks, were
perpetrating their malicious designs against me. He, the said
John Forbes, asked the said John Chinn what was he going
to do with that Hatchet. John Chinn replyed, to break down
the Doctor&rsquo;s house. After a little altercation my servant persuaded
him to deliver up the Hatchet.</p>
<p>No sooner the assailants abovesaid was expelled the house,
as above mentioned, then the said John Chinn entered my
house abruptly, as straight as a rush, &amp; with an air of authority,
impudently (tho&rsquo; he saw my face &amp;c. all over with
blood besmeared) minding his belly more than my hard treatment
asked if I should give him a bowl of Toddy, in presence
of Mr. Maxwell &amp; Mr. Burgy.</p>
<p>When these irregular proceedings perspired [<i>sic!</i>] the
most considerable gentlemen in the Garrison came to see
me, to wit, Capt. [Beamsley] Glazier [commandant, 1768-70],
Lieut. Nordberg, Lieut. [John] Christie, Ens. Strickland, Mr.
Todd, Mr. Main, Mr. [Charles?] Morison, Mr. Maxwell &amp;
Christian Burgy, who can all &amp; one of them attest they plainly
saw that the door of my house &amp;c. were forcibly broke open
as abovesaid, &amp; that my face &amp;c. was all over besmeared with
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
blood &amp; gore, &amp; my shirt, sheets, pillowcase, were plentifully
bespattered with blood also.</p>
<p>John Chinn, upon Recollecting what he had done, [realized
he had] forgot his Hatchet, which he was very impatient
to have in his possession once more, as it was then in custody
of my servant John Forbes for about half one hour. The said
John Chinn employed Christian Burgy, abovesaid, to bring it
back to him. I did not chuse to give it, but upon the said
Christian Burgy&rsquo;s earnest Expostulations I complyed, &amp; ordered
my servant to deliver it. At the same time [I] told
Christian Burgy it was to the same purpose, as he &amp; my servant
could testify with Isaac Todd, [to] the maliciousness
of his [Chinn&rsquo;s] unwarrantable intentions as abovesaid.</p>
<p>Soon after Ens. Johnstone &amp; his abbettor Forrest Oaks
had been expelled my house, he, the said Ens. Johnstone,
went to Ens. Strickland&rsquo;s. The abovesaid Isaac Todd happened
to be there, who upon Johnston&rsquo;s appearing, observed
blood upon his hands &amp;c. [Isaac Todd] asked him, where
he had been. The said Ensign Johnstone replyed Vauntingly,
he was giveing some knocks to the Doctor.</p>
<p>About half one hour after seven the evening before, Ens.
Johnstone with some other accomplices were discovered scaling
up a ladder opposite to which there was a half door, up
the loft, at the lower end of my house. My servant John
Forbes &amp; another soldier observing a noise, as if the half
door was thrown down upon the loft, [started out] but before
my servant &amp; the other soldier could get out to make a
real discovery, the attempters were scattered about different
ways. What their intentions were in regard to this little Enterprise
depends upon them to explain but the judicious may
readily conclude it a prelude to their malicious perpetrations
before daylight next morning.</p>
<p>Before, at, or about six weeks preceeding the 7th November
abovesaid, there was a strong report prevailed in [the]
Garrison (which I am now persuaded was not without foundation)
that the said Ens. Johnstone, being in company with
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
some gentlemen in the fort, had breathed out menaceing and
malevolent expressions against me, threatening he would
use me ill.</p>
<p>Ens. Johnstone&rsquo;s reasons for this extravagant Declaration
I am yet a stranger to, as it is conscious to myself I never
did in word or deed give him any just grounds of provocation.
Notwithstanding this surmise, I took no further notice of
[it] than studying to evade his Company, excepting behaveing
with common civility on general terms, as I knew his
Character among the public to be of a turbulent &amp; troublesome,
meddling [and] loquacious Disposition.</p>
<p>Upon the whole, I believe, it will not be attended with
much Difficulty to investigate sufficient evidences, who will
attest to the Veracity of the above, when they are legally
called upon to declare their Sentiments, Solemnly without the
least partiality or mental reservation in presence of any competent
Tribunal, by which it will evidently appear (to the
Judicious) with other concurring Circumstances that the
forcibly breaking up of my house &amp;c., together with the
violent assault upon my person as above specifyed, may be
justly attributed to premeditated &amp; malicious intentions.
Authentick witnesses to prove the last assertion are Isaac
Todd, Benjiman Roberts, late Lieut. in the 46th Regt., Benjiman
Frobbisher, merchant, &amp; William Maxwell, Commissary
of Provisions in this Fort.</p>
<p>N. B.: When Sergt. McMurray &amp; Arthur Ross came into
my house they found Ens. Johnstone holding my servant by
the hair of his head &amp; pelting at him with several knocks
altennarly [alternately?] for attempting to force him out of
the house, which he got accomplished with the assistance of
Sergt. MacMurray &amp; Arthur Ross.</p>
<p>N. B.: That in the month of March 1766, he [Johnson]
threatened he would break my head. No sooner [did] I
put myself in a position of Defence, but he desisted from
his insolent menaces. Proof: Lieut. Allan Grant of the 2d.
Battn., Lieut. Varingon &amp; Adjutant Biron [John Burrent],
both of the 1st. Battn. 60th Regt.</p>

which, however, with the exception of an occasional difference
in wording are the same. Following these events, from
time to time he recorded some of the &ldquo;irregular proceedings&rdquo;
which transpired at the fort, largely as a result of the actions
of the irrepressible Ensign Johnson.</i></p>
<p><i>Morison&rsquo;s journal illustrates vividly how completely the
military authorities dominated the lives of the fort&rsquo;s inhabitants.
Not only were the soldiers at the mercy of their officers,
but civilians, such as Morison&rsquo;s nephew, William Morison,
were helpless in the face of military indifference to their
problems since there was no civil authority at Michilimackinac
or anywhere else in what is now Michigan to which
they might appeal during this period. Traders constantly
complained at the high-handed actions of the fort&rsquo;s commanders
who, these traders charged, used their position to
gain great material benefits for themselves and imposed
ruinous regulations on those traders who would not give
them a cut of their profits. The royal government sought to
correct these abuses, but throughout the period of British
rule Michilimackinac is said to have had a reputation as a
center of corruption and misrule.</i></p>

<p>[1stly.] That a few days after this unwarrantable Outrage
perpetrated against my dwelling House &amp; person, John Chinn
&amp; Forrest Oaks were so conscious of their Enormous guilt
[and] struck with such a Remorse, that they declared that
they would upon their knees publickly on the Parade beg
to be pardoned if that would satisfy for the Errors they were
conscious of haveing committed. This they expressed in the
Audience of William Maxwell, Commissary, Sergt. McMurray,
George McBeath, [and] Henry Williams, traders.</p>
<p>2dly. That a certain gentleman heard it surmised among
them that if the above Submission would not take place, they
might have another Resolve which was to tamper with my
Servant &amp; advance him one hundred pounds by way of bribe,
as they looked on him as the most Material witness in my
intended process against them.</p>
<p>3rdly. Such is the depraved disposition of this profligate
Garrison at this Juncture (as well as now degenerateing into
the most irregular proceedings dayly) they had recourse to
calumnious aspersions contriveing to patch up false invective
&amp; ignominous Reports (as under the Necessity of keeping my
room, on account of the Severe [bruises] I had sustained from
such a rough handleing, that I wore Boots with Creepers in
my Room &amp; [was] found lying down in my bed with them);
with this additional &amp; abominable connivance that I kept so
long close in my Room to embrace one opportunity to drive
away Sorrow &amp; get drunk privately. Such are the Diabolical
dispositions of many in this remote garrison who make a
perpetual habit of murdering time in excesses of Debauchery
&amp; most Licentious practices. These false aspersions I had
communicated to me by George Main and Charles Morison,
trader, the 10th December, 1769.</p>
<p>4thly. Upon the 11th do. Ens. Johnstone assumed to encroach
upon my Province by visiting Sergt. McPherson of
the Colonel&rsquo;s Company, who says he never sent for him
Directly or indirectly. He immediately insisted upon seeing
his wound, tho&rsquo; he was but newly dressed one hour before,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
[and] took off the dressings, &amp;c. After inspection he told my
patient for his comfort, it looked very bad, &amp; that he knew
nothing better for him than to bathe it with brandy. [He]
set off directly, &amp; left the tumefyed wound exposed to the
Open air, till my servant was obliged to go &amp; dress him a
second time. This among the rest is one specimen of the
Ens. Johnstone&rsquo;s activity to interfere in matters which did
not concern him. That at the same time he told Sergt. McPherson
if he belonged to the Company, he [would give]
commands. He would immediately confine Dr. Morison in the
common guard house.</p>
<p>N. B.: That in a few days after this Violent Assault, John
Chinn and Forrest Oaks were observed conjointly &amp; severally,
loading their guns &amp; pistoles, which I dare say were intended
for bad purposes which they would in all appearance have
prosecuted had not their proceedings been disapproved of by
a certain gentleman in the Garrison.</p>
<p>One night the ensueing spring, when they carroused heartily
at their Bowl, John Chinn proposed to pay another Visit
to the Doctor, which being disapproved of by one of the
principals in the Assault, was dropped.</p>
<p>The 25th. December 1769. Ens. Johnstone with his irregular
associates, contrived among them, about day set in
the evening, to send a frenchman, who served Isaac Todd
merchant, upon a false Message to me two different times in
great haste, acquainting me that his master was very sick, &amp;
that he earnestly, in the most pressing manner, demanded my
immediate assistance. Upon which I Repaired directly to
wait upon Mr. Todd, &amp; upon due enquiry, found the Message
to be a mere bubble, very like the triffling projectors, Isaac
Todd declareing himself well, &amp; took it highly amiss that they
should take such libertys with his name, or give me such
Unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>Some time in Summer 1770, Ens. Johnstone Knocked down
a soldier of the general&rsquo;s Company, called Walker by name,
in presence of the Commanding officer, Capt. [George] Turnbull.
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
The poor soldier applyed to me, &amp; told me he was afraid
his cheek bone was broke, which did not happen to be the
case, tho&rsquo; it was prodigiously swelled. Which cost me five
or six days attendance and applications, before he recovered
so as to be fit for Duty.</p>
<p>Sunday evening at 11 O&rsquo;clock, 2d. December 1770, a
frenchman knocked at the door of my house very hard, when
I was abed. Imagining it Might be from some sick soldier,
[I] called to my servant to open the Door, &amp; there appeared
a frenchman with a card in his hand, charged with Mr.
Chinn&rsquo;s Compliments to Doctor Morison, begging the favour
of his Company to take a dance with them at Christian
Burge&rsquo;s house. This I rejected with outmost derision &amp; Contempt,
as I never did prostitute my judgement so low as to
join Company of any Denomination to break the Lord&rsquo;s day
in such a publick [and] infamous manner; &amp; indeed I looked
upon the Company so mean that I should be very scrupulous
to join them even on a Weekly day. I doubt not but Ens.
Johnstone might be at the head of such a Heathenish proposition
as there is no irregularitys committed here, wherein he
is not either a prompter or a ready Countenancer if not a
perpetrator.</p>
<p>Sunday the 9th December 1770. Betwixt the hours of 11
&amp; 12 o&rsquo;Clock forenoon, when the Garrison was at Church,
Sergt. [Thomas] Carlile of the general&rsquo;s company had the
guard that day, &amp; being thirsty stepped over to his own
house (which was adjacent &amp; directly opposite to his guard)
for a drink of spruce beer. He no sooner opened the Door
of his room than Ens. Johnstone (who was there with his
wife) saluted him with innumberable knocks &amp; kicks till
(almost in his own words to me) he had knocked his head
into blubber, then kicked him in the private parts (from
which Violence his private parts, particularly one of his
testicles, are greatly Swelled, of a hue black as his Hat).
[Johnson gave him] many bumps upon his head, [and]
his jaw bones, as he himself says, [are] so painful that he
can scarce open his mouth, but with great difficulty.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The poor Sergt. immediately returned to his guard &amp; the
next day applyed to the commanding officer Capt. Turnbull
of this Fort for his Protection in regard to his most grievious
situation, from the Attrocious and barbarous usage he had
sustained by the violent proceedings of Ens. Johnstone whom
he was determined to prosecute to the outmost for the Violence
done to his person, in his own house.</p>
<p>N. B.: Ens. Johnstone confined two or three soldiers in
the black-hole for being absent from Divine service, where
they were in durance while he himself was pounding &amp; kicking
the poor Sergt. in this barbarous manner.</p>
<p>Late in the evening Sunday above said, Ens. Johnstone
was swaggering away upon the Parade with a naked sword,
or Dagger, in his hand, &amp; when it seems he could not meet
a Humane [<i>sic</i>] Subject to Use ill, he wrecked his Vengeance
on a dog (belonging to one of the Soldiers of the Garrison)
by cutting him to the back-bone. The poor brute made such
a hideous noise, his wound being beyond Remedy, [that]
his master was obliged out of Pity to put him out of pain by
shooting him thro&rsquo; the head.</p>
<p>Wednesday 12th December 1770. A little before Roll-Call
Ens. Johnstone struck my servant, John Forbes, by giveing
him several blows, which hurt him prodigiously, for attempting
to ridd some Dogs that were a fighting &amp; make[ing] a
terrible Noise at the Door of my house. He struck Sergt.
McMurray, acting Sergt. Major in the fort, with a severe
blow, at the same time knocked down flat [on] the ground
Henry Adams of the Collonel&rsquo;s Company, so that the dogs
of this garrison are so Usefull, Sergents &amp; Soldiers must be
knocked down for attempting to hinder them from fighting &amp;
makeing a noise.</p>
<p>Ens. Johnstone kicked Sergt. McPherson of the Collonel&rsquo;s
Company in presence of the Commanding officer, a little
before he went down to Detroit last fall. Wednesday 26th
December 1770, upon the evening of that day Ens. Johnstone
knocked down Sergt. May upon the Parade, by giveing
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
him two severe blows on the neck &amp; Jawbones, after which
he confined him, brought him to a tryal, &amp; sentenced [him]
to be reduced to the ranks.</p>
<p>On Saturday 29th, Do., Ens. Johnstone wrangled with my
nephew, William Morison, erroneously &amp; threatened to confine
him in the common guard-house.</p>
<p>Sunday evening 30th Do., Mrs. [George] McBeath invited
me to walk into her house. I was no sooner seated than
she entered a grieveous Complaint to me against Ens. Johnstone,
affirming that he used uncommon libertys with her
Character, upon which she wrote him the evening before a
very spirited Letter of which she shewed me a Copy. She
actually pronounced him a very bad man. As a strong instance
of which, among many she could adduce, she declared he
had frequently tampered with her by many stratagems to
destroy her peace with her husband, which she looked upon
as such a vile insinuation she was determined never to admit
of his Company for the future.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening the 1st. Jan&rsquo;y 1771. John Savage, Taylor
&amp; Soldier in the general&rsquo;s Company, twixt 11 &amp; 12, had the
Door of his house forced open [and was] committed to the
guard-house for not suffering his wife to comply with obscene
proposit[ions made] to her. At this Exploit Ens. Johnstone
was one of the chief witnesses. The prisoner was set at liberty
next morning without any crime given against him.</p>
<p>Monday the 7th Jan&rsquo;y 1771. Ens. Johnstone decoyed away
Sergt. Carlile&rsquo;s wife, which he has been contriveing to accomplish
many months before this finishing stroake, &amp; tho&rsquo;
her husband was like to break his Heart, and crying out
his Eyes on the occasion, Yet no Remonstrances would be
payed the least attention to. Ens. Johnstone quitted his Room
in the officer&rsquo;s barracks that evening which he exchanged with
Mr. Main for his. [He] sleeped with her that night in his
new room where he lives with her still, without dread or
shame, while the poor Husband is left in such a disconsolate
situation that is not easy to describe. He next morning (poor
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
man) applyed to the Commanding Officer, who gave him no
satisfactory redress, as he did not chuse to interfere either
pro or con. Yet the next day after her Elopement from her
husband she had the honnour of dining with the commanding
officer and his mess, who drank tea with her that evening at
her new lodgeings.</p>
<p>Sergt. Carlile had the mortification to see his wife dayly
conducted by one of the mess to dine with the commanding
officer, Capt. Turnbul, &amp; the good Company with him, at
which the poor Sergt. was like to go distracted but could
not help himself.</p>
<p>Ens. Johnstone in the month [of December?] 1770, haveing
crossed on a party of pleasure in company with Capt.
Turnbull &amp; William Maxwell, Commissary, flogged Knight,
Soldier in the general&rsquo;s Company, with his own hand, without
any regular tryal for his crime. Proof: William Maxwell, Commissary,
Rogers &amp; McLean, soldiers.</p>
<p>As Ens. Johnstone thought proper to turn trader by selling
of common rum to the soldiers &amp; all others by whom he
might gain a penny in this clandestine Manner, in the month
of October 1767, he was observed to have filled up several
Barrels of common rum with boiling water to make up the
Leakage. Afterwards [he] sold this at 18. sh. York currency
pr. gallon to Sergeants &amp; Soldiers &amp;c. in the Garrison. Proof:
Sergeants McMurray &amp; Carlile with his own servant Arthur
Ross, who assisted him by his own self in the deceitfull
operation.</p>
<p>Upon friday the 8th febry. 1771, Ens. Johnstone in presence
of the Commanding officer, Capt. Turnbull, Ens. Strickland,
George Main, William Maxwell, Commissary, [and]
George McBeath, trader, attacked William Morison, my
nephew, in a most rude and Violent manner, without any
evident cause, in the billiard Room in the presence of six
witnesses. The Young man (who is sometimes liable to a
fainting Disposition) in the Scuffle he fell down &amp; cryed
Murder! William Maxwell, Commissary of provisions, interposed,
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
by which he received some knocks from Ens. Johnstone
without returning one blow, after which Johnstone
passed by [the] Commissary in a furious manner, &amp; the young
man was flat down in a swoon. Ens. Johnstone raised up his
left arm &amp; gave him repeated thumps opposite to the heart,
by which it would appear he intended to murder the young
man.</p>
<p>He is now under care &amp; it is a chance if ever he can get
the better of it. The commanding officer with all those of their
Club was present to all this. Some of them I am told stood
firm with their backs to the room door, I suppose to hinder
any from comeing in to the assistance of the ill-used Young
man. At length the noise brought in Mr. Harise, who can
attest to everything he saw. Mr. Harise with one or two more
carryed him for dead to his room, where after untying his
stock he gradually recovered from his trance.</p>
<p>In the evening I went with my Nephew to wait on Capt.
Turnbull to enter a Complaint of his hard usage. After all
the remonstrances he could suggest, the Commanding Officer
would give him no Redress, tho&rsquo; he himself was personally
present to the crime committed by Johnstone. Upon which I
myself made application to Capt. Turnbull in the humblest
manner to put Ens. Johnstone under arrest &amp; that there was
no possibility of maintaining peace in the Garrison while
Johnstone was at liberty, nor could I think myself safe in the
Execution of my Office if my Remonstrances to him on that
score did not take place, which Capt. Turnbull Absolutely
refused to do by saying, with some warmth, he would not
put Johnstone under arrest, tho&rsquo; there [were] as many crimes
against him as words on his Commission.</p>
<p>The 23d. feby. 1771. Ens. Johnstone quarrelled with William
Maxwell, Commissary, &amp; revilled [him] (if not gave him
a few blows) with exasperating expressions, both in company
of the commanding officer, who, when words became
too high, ordered Ens. Johnstone to his room, wherein he
did not continue above twenty four hours, for reasons best
known to the Commanding Officer &amp; himself.</p>

</div>
<p><i><b><span class="xlarge">T</span></b>he little domestic tragedy involving Sergeant Thomas
Carlile, his wife, and Ensign Robert Johnson, the first two
acts of which transpired in the last chapter, now comes to
an end with the utter defeat and humiliation of the poor
sergeant.</i></p>
<p><i>Brought to trial on a charge of being disrespectful to an
officer, Carlile sought to get his case tried not by a regimental
court-martial, but by a general court-martial which would
have a larger number of judges, including officers from other
units, who would be more likely to judge his case without
prejudice. With Ensign Johnson sitting as a member of the
court it is not surprising that Carlile&rsquo;s request was denied
nor that he was found guilty and reduced to the rank of
private.</i></p>
<p><i>Carlile shortly was restored to his sergeant&rsquo;s rating but
only after agreeing to take back his faithless wife and writing
a letter at Johnson&rsquo;s order in which he abjectly begged
forgiveness for daring to suggest that the ensign ought not
to sit as a member of the court.</i></p>
<p><i>The record of Carlile&rsquo;s court-martial was stricken from
the regimental orderly book, but Morison copied the proceedings
as follows:</i></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p><i>Michilamackinac, February 16th, 1771.</i></p>
<p><i>Proceedings of a Regimental Court Martial, 2d. Battn. 60th

<p><span class="lr"><i>President&mdash;Lieut. Christie</i></span></p>
<p><i>Prisoner, Sergt. Carlile</i></p>
<p><span class="lr"><i>Ens. Johnstone, member</i></span></p>
<p><i>Confined by order of Ens. Strickland for being insolent
&amp; behaveing with Disrespect to him. Ens. Strickland informs
the Court that he went a Carrioling [riding in a cariole, a
kind of sleigh] with a Woman under his Protection (namely
Sergt. Carlile&rsquo;s wife and Ens. Johnstone&rsquo;s whore) [and] that
the prisoner came up and wished that the Carriole, horse
and all, might break in &amp; go under the ice, with other insolent
Language.</i></p>
<p><i>The Prisoner being put to defence denys the crime &amp;
says he will not be tryed by a Regimental Courtmartial, but
desires a general one, &amp; objects to Ens. Johnstone, for reasons
he now will not mention. The Court is of oppinion the
prisoner is guilty of the crime laid to his Charge, therefore
do sentence him to be reduced and serve as private in the
Ranks.</i></p>
<p><span class="lr"><i>Signed/ Lieut. Christie, president</i></span></p>
<p><span class="lr"><i>Approved, George Turnbull, Commandant.</i></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Febry 1st. 1771. Ens. Johnstone by threats &amp; promises
prevailed upon Sergt. Carlile, by frequent tamperings &amp;
Solicitations, to take his wife back again. I imagine upon
Examination of this accommodation it will appear equally
abominable as the original iniquitous &amp; intrigueing proceedings.</p>
<p>The 23d febry 1771. Ensigns Johnstone &amp; Strickland haveing
requested of the commanding officer that Thomas Carlile,
late Sergt. in generall Armstrong&rsquo;s Company, should be restored,
he is therefore restored to his former rank (after
signing, I fancy, uncommon preliminarys dictated to him by
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
the Destroyer of his peace and tranquility). He is to be
obeyed as such. One infamous restoration indeed when the
terms are narrowly scrutinized.</p>
<p>N. B.: That upon the 26th febry. 1771. Capt. Turnbull,
Commandant, Issued verbal orders to Sergt. [Mc]Murray of
the General&rsquo;s Company to Erase the proceedings of the
Regimental Court Martial concerning Sergt. Carlile&rsquo;s tryal
out of the Regimental Orderly book, &amp; if he could, would get
it Erased out of the orderly book of the Lieut. Colonel&rsquo;s
Company also. Accordingly Sergt. McGann of the Colonel&rsquo;s
Company did erase it, without any previous notice given to
the officer who commanded the Company. As that officer was
not a little surprized at such uncommon proceedings, he immediately
confined him in the guard-house, who in his own
defence told his officer he received positive orders from the
acting Sergt. Major so to do, who had told him it was the
orders of the day by the commanding officer, Capt. Turnbull.
Upon which the officer commanding the Coll&rsquo;s Company
sent for the acting Sergt. Major who acknowledged to him
he had received orders from the Commanding officer of the
Fort to have the tryall of Sergt. Carlile torn out of the Book
of both Companies doing duty in Garrison. Upon which
Declaration the officer set Sergt. McGann at liberty.</p>

altho&rsquo; I am now well convinced that his own Honnour would
not allow him to do anything prejudicial to Justice. The only
Excuse I can make to him &amp; Ens. Strickland is that a Woman

against Ensign Johnson into a catalogue of his &ldquo;exploits.&rdquo;
In addition to proving that the ensign was a respecter
of no one, regardless of age, rank, sex, or position, the catalogue
includes the intriguing report of alleged intimacies
between Johnson and Mrs. Robert Rogers. This information
may be true since we learn from another source that Major
Rogers was said to have been jealous of Johnson. The ironical
aspect of this whole matter is that ten years later when
Elizabeth Rogers sued for a divorce from the major one of
her grounds for the action was that her husband had been
unfaithful to her while they were at Michilimackinac.</i></p>
<p><i>Ensign Johnson finally met his match in the tough Connecticut
trader, Phineas Pond, and resigned his commission

<p><i>Sentencing a soldier to receive a thousand lashes, which
Morison also relates in this chapter, was an unusually brutal
penalty, although at least one sentence of fifteen-hundred

<p><b><span class="xlarge">M</span></b>ichilamackinack, 10th Aprile 1771. Ens. Johnstone attempted
a rape on a girl betwixt nine &amp; ten Years of age.
Her shrieking out Violently alarmed her step-father, Arthur
Ross, &amp; others in the barracks. This Arthur Ross was servant
to Ens. Johnstone at the time, who upon makeing remonstrances
the next morning to Ens. Johnstone of his rude &amp; uncommon
behaveour, Received a very severe blow on the left
breast from his master, Ens. Johnstone, which made him quit
his service instantly.</p>
<p>Ens. Johnstone acknowledged publickly, by way of
Bravado, he had carnal dealings with Mrs. Oldham (the
mother of this girl upon whom he attempted this Rape) three
years agoe, and about twenty Days agoe he vaunted of the
same foul deed, declaring publickly it was [no one&rsquo;s business?].
This declaration happened two or three days before
he attempted the Rape upon her Young Daughter.</p>
<p>Tuesday the 23d Aprile 1771. We had a kind of horse
race here; the most of the garrison walked out to enjoy the
pleasure of the Show. Ens. Johnstone being appointed as one
of the Judges upon the Occasion, Ens. Strickland&rsquo;s mare was
saddled for him, that he might be enabled to execute the
important office with the more Alacrity. The racers appeared
on the ground expecting Ens. Johnstone with outmost impatience.
[They] sent several messages in quest of him; his
mare was found; but he himself could not, &amp; no wonder for
he was then in a Captain&rsquo;s Cabin marking barrells of Liquor
to be Rolled over to the Suttler&rsquo;s house, which was observed
to be conveyed in this manner by Creditable Witnesses. Ens.
Johnstone seized this opportunity very seasonably while the
racers waited half one hour for his Judicial appearance before
they could start.</p>
<p>After secureing his Cargoe in this manner he appeared
soon after the racers started. The horse won &amp; the mare lost
the race (which is a surprizing Circumstance) according
[to] the prevailing constitution of this fort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Thursday 25th. Aprile 1771. A Barrell of Liquor, at least
presumed to be, was Rolled over to the Suttler&rsquo;s about 12
o&rsquo;clock forenoon. This Barrell was marked Capt G. T. [George
Turnbull] &amp; rolled over by Donaldson [?] of the General&rsquo;s
Company.</p>

James Coleman, soldier of the Lieut Colonel&rsquo;s Company,
sentenced to Receive 1000 Lashes for Desertion, received
near five hundred &amp; would have received more had
not I intervened to hinder any more proceedings as he was
not able to endure any more.</p>
<p>That very evening of the 30th he was ordered by the
Commanding officer to the flogging post to receive the rest
of his punishment, without Consulting me whether he was
fit to receive them or not. He appeared under a file of men,
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
in presence of the whole garrison, to undergoe that which he
was not able to support. At that Juncture, he immediately
fell upon his Knees &amp; begged Capt. Turnbull to delay the
rest of his punishment till he was more fit to undergoe them.
Upon this application Capt. Turnbull asked my oppinion. I
answered he was not fit, &amp; consequently he was under the
necessity of being carryed home to the Guard house by two
soldiers of the guard.</p>
<p>This lenity of mine in favours of the prisoner produced the
following Garrison orders (tho&rsquo; there was no previous complaint
lodged):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Michilimackinac 31. May 1771. For the future the officer
of the Day will visit the men&rsquo;s barracks every forenoon at
12 o&rsquo;clock to see that the Barracks are kept clean &amp; that the
sick or lame are regularly visited by the Surgeon; when
prisoners are in that situation the Sergt. of the Guard will
report to the officer of the day if it should happen that they
are not Regularly attended.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The 10th of June 1771. Ens. Johnstone quarrelled with
Phinehas Pond, a trader from New England. The dispute became
very warm with high &amp; insulting Expressions. At length
in the height of their dispute Ens. Johnstone took down a
brace of pistoles off the chimney brace, presented them to
Pond at the Table, challengeing him to take up one of them,
which Phineas Pond did directly. Ens. Johnstone in wrath
desired Mr. Pond to give his Pistol to Mr. Howard, trader,
to charge. He replyed he would not give his Pistol to any
man to charge; upon which Pond began to charge his Pistol
as fast as he could work. Ens. Johnstone (observeing that
Mr. Pond was about chargeing so brisk) took hold of his own
pistol by the barrell &amp; pushed the butt of it violently &amp;
struck him with great fury in the Pit of the stomach, which
staggered him surpriseingly. This unexpected proceeding prevented
Pond from loading his Pistol, which he was obliged
to drop &amp; make of his hands in his own defence, which he
plyed about so manfully that Ens. Johnstone fell flat directly
upon the floor. Phineas Pond gave him such terrible bruiseings,
black eyes &amp;c. that Ens. Johnstone was obliged to keep
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
his Room for several days, &amp; tho&rsquo; this day is the 6th. since
his disaster, he is not Yet recovered, walking about slowly
with a pair of black Eyes. What the consequences of this
uggly affair will turn out to I cannot determine.</p>
<p>Ensign Johnstone sold Mr. [Ezekial] Solomon the Jew
ninety gallons of common Rum June 1771. The year before
he sold fifty bundles of dryed Venison to the said Solomon
at 2 sh. &amp; 6d for the benefit of Capt. Turnbull, commanding
officer of this Fort.</p>

<p><i><b><span class="xlarge">W</span></b>ith this partial quotation of a line from Virgil&rsquo;s Aeneid
which refers to the hideous one-eyed monster, Polyphemus,
stumbling about after he had been blinded by Ulysses, Morison
expresses his opinion of Captain Turnbull. Angered at
the treatment he received from Turnbull, the surgeon&rsquo;s mate
presumably pictured his commanding officer as a monster,
blind to the needs of his men.</i></p>
<p><i>George Turnbull had received his commission in the
Royal Americans in 1756 at the time this famous fighting
force was being recruited &ldquo;to avenge Braddock&rsquo;s defeat.&rdquo;
In 1758 he had been wounded in the costly British attack
on Ticonderoga. After the French and Indian War, Turnbull
was promoted to captain in 1765, and before coming
to Michilimackinac in 1770 he had been the commander
at Detroit for three years. While at Detroit he had been involved
with some of the local citizens in a dispute over property
rights on Belle Isle, but, according to the adventurer,
Jonathan Carver, who visited Detroit in 1768, Turnbull was
respected by the inhabitants and traders &ldquo;for the propriety
of his conduct.&rdquo; This record should be borne in mind as one
reads what Morison has to say about Turnbull.</i></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p><b><span class="xlarge">M</span></b>ichilamackinac July 9th. 1771. Betwixt the hours of 3
&amp; 4 [in the] afternoon, Capt. Turnbull sent for me to his
house upon an affair in which he had not the least concern.
No sooner I appeared than he Opened upon me with Volleys
of scurrilous Language (in presence of Lieut. Donald McAlpin
of the 2d. Battn.) viz: That I was a scandalous fellow,
a man of no principles, of a bad heart &amp;c. lastly ordered me
go out of his house &amp; commanded me to keep my Distance,
which I am determined punctually to observe.</p>
<p>N. B.: All these Epithets (to the conviction of many)
are imputations that more peculiarly belong <i>altenarly</i> [alternately?]
to himself when his character is canvassed by
proper judges. If [such things as] Oppression, Detraction,
Melediction, Violence, fornication, adultery, breach of Sabbath,
tradeing, selling of common rum, Molasses, Wine,
Spirits &amp;c., Supporting a Suttlery in which he himself is principally
[interested], which is Diametrically opposed to a
Military Character, [be considered], he himself is justly entitled
to these Epithets &amp; imputations which cannot be attended
with much difficulty to prove. Upon these considerations
I left his house, whose dirt I shook off from my feet &amp;
left the Dirt where I found it. Monstrum horrendum Ingens!</p>
<p>The 26th. augst. 1771. Sent the weekly return by my
servt. as I happened to be sick on that morning. Capt. Turnbull
enquired of my servt. what my sickness was. My servt.
answered, it was a severe attack of the Rheumatism to which
I was subject. The Commandant asked my servt. if he could
cure me. My servt. replyed he would if he could. After many
frivolous questions of this nature, he at last ask[ed] him
what did he think I deserved, to which my servt. Replyed,
he did not know, &ldquo;but Sure I am Sir, my master deserves well
at my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon Tuesday the 17th. Sept. 1771. Capt. Turnbull after
Roll Call sent the Sergeant Major to acquaint me he wanted
to speak to me. Accordingly I appeared. Then Capt. Turnbull
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
in presence of Lieut. Christie, Ens. Graham and Ens. Strickland
asked how I came to move to another house without his
leave, &amp; I answered that I thought there was no necessity
of giveing any trouble to him for removeing to good Quarters,
which I hired for the Winter as there was no possibility of
liveing for the Winter in that house Which he ordered me to,
May last; especially as both of them were the property of
traders in this place &amp; tho&rsquo; I applyed to him last fall for a
Room in the officers&rsquo; Barracks, as there was one Vacant then,
as he did not grant this I thought I had a Right to provide
myself the best I could.</p>
<p>He told me [that] tho&rsquo; I have been so long in the army
I made a[s] great progress in the knowledge of my duty as
I did in that of my profession, meaning in which I appeared
to be equally ignorant. (So far according to the Sultan.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;You want I should put You into
arrest, that You may be exempted from Your duty. But,&rdquo;
continued he, &ldquo;I will not do You that Honnour. You are not
worth my Notice. I hope You will not give me the trouble
to provide a Room to provide for You next summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told him I&rsquo;d give him as little trouble as possible and
that I&rsquo;d endeavour [to do] the best I could for myself, tho&rsquo;
at the same time I beged leave to observe that I thought
(while I continued to act in the King&rsquo;s Service) I had a right
to a room in the King&rsquo;s barracks, which benefit was never
granted me during his incumbency. He Replyed he did not
chuse to hear any more upon the Subject, and ordered me
to be gone, which I did quietly, in presence of the abovesaid
gentlemen.</p>
<p>N. B.: When upon application last fall to Capt. Turnbull
for a Room in the King&rsquo;s Barracks, which he did not grant,
I then applyed to him if he would please speak to influence
Mr. Cardin to give me his house for last winter. He gave
himself not the least trouble about the matter, in consequence
of which I was necessitated to provide for myself. [I] obtained
the house from Mr. Cardin, where I lodged Comfortably
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
last winter. As I was obliged to pass the winters
preceeding most wretchedly in old houses, not habitable,
notwithstanding of my Disbursements on many repeated
reparations, such as thatching with Bark, Claying &amp;c, as
without these expenses I must starve of cold &amp; every shower
of rain [came] in upon me, as also snow drift[ed in] from
every quarter when the wind blew high.</p>
<p>Upon Sunday the 1st December 1771. The officer of the
day was ordered to place Centrys at different corners of the
Garrison upon four or five houses, upon suspicion they smuggled
some common rum to entertain them[selves] at such a
particular Season, as one of the Sub-Suttlers did not Chuse
to sell or had orders [not] to sell under a Dollar each quart.</p>
<p>A soldier and his wife with his Children [were] ordered
to their barracks, tho&rsquo; there was not a drop [of] liquor found
in his house. The officer of the day upon entring the room
of Fiddler, one of the Royal Artillery, who was enjoying himself
with one of his Comrades in garrison [with some rum]
which he had purchassed from the Sub-Suttler. [The bottle
of rum] was broke to pieces [by the officer] which put a
stop to the entertainment tho&rsquo; they were all quite sober.</p>
<p>All this is supposed to proceed from the orders of the
grand Suttler [Captain Turnbull], who did not Chuse that
any individual should interfere in diminishing the grist which
has been a long time now comeing into his Mill &amp; which he
wants to keep agoing for his own particular private interest.</p>
<p>December 15th. Mr. Harise, the interpreter, was committed
to the common guard-house by Capt. Turnbull where
he remained from eight o&rsquo;Clock in the afternoon till ten
next morning, for beating of a trader&rsquo;s <i>Engagee</i> [an <i>engag&eacute;</i>,
one of the French boatmen who were hired to paddle the
traders&rsquo; canoes], tho&rsquo; many Circumstances of the most Extravagant
enormitys have been overlooked in this odious
garrison during Capt. Turnbull&rsquo;s Incumbency.</p>
<p>Ensign Strickland [was] put under arrest by Capt. Turnbull&rsquo;s
order for useing Sergt. Lewis ill upon his Guard, &amp; the
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
said Ensign continued under his arrest untill he made proper
Condescensions to the Sergt. &amp; Yet Ensign Johnstone would
not be put under arrest by Captain Turnbull (tho&rsquo; properly
applyed to) for shedding the blood of a gentleman more
usefull to the King&rsquo;s service in garrison, more than both,
which can be proven to a Demonstration, time &amp; place Convenient.</p>
<p>N. B.: July 2d. 1772. I have now [served] going on four
years here, &amp; during that period of time have neither received
wood, nor chairs, table, tongs, Dogirons, pockers, &amp;c.
from the Barrack master nor any lodgeing in the King&rsquo;s
Barracks or from the King, notwithstanding my frequent applications,
but was obliged to Lodge in old french Houses,
not habitable, at a Vast Expense out of my Pay, by Plastering,
thatching &amp;c. to preserve myself from the Inclemency of the
Winter Season, which is generally very intense here, and
which continues upon average about the space of eight
months.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding so badly was I used, on account of provideing
of aforesaid lodgeings, haveing not beforehand informed
Capt. Turnbull of my intention of providing said
Lodgeing for hire, he sent a Sergeant for me to [attend]
the Publick parade, where to my surprise in presence of
the officers of the Garrison &amp; others he gave me very abusive
&amp; Scandalous Language, unbecomeing the Expressions of a
gentleman, &amp; when offering to speak in my own Defence,
I was ordered Silence! &amp; that he desired for the future I
should give him no more trouble about Lodgeings. [He]
ordered me about my business, that he would not put me
under arrested as he knew that was what I wanted, but
would not do me that Honnour. I was not worth his notice.</p>
<p>N. B.: Ensign Strickland &amp; Ens. Graham were put under
arrest for differences subsisting among them at his house,
which Capt. Turnbull approved of till their differences were
settled.</p>

<p><i><b><span class="xlarge">D</span></b>aniel Morison&rsquo;s journal ends at this point. After July
2, 1772, we lose sight of the unhappy surgeon&rsquo;s mate. It
appears at least that he did not remain much longer at the
Straits for later that year the various units of the Second
Battalion of the Royal Americans were assembled from Niagara,
Fort Michilimackinac, and other frontier posts and
shipped off to serve in the balmier climate of the West Indies.</i></p>
<p><i>Captain Turnbull retired from the army in 1775 by selling
his commission, but some of the others who had served at
Michilimackinac remained with the Royal Americans and
fought in the Revolutionary War. Turnbull&rsquo;s predecessor as
commandant, Beamsley Glazier, distinguished himself in the
fighting around Savannah, Georgia, in 1779, by leading three
companies of the Royal Americans in a fierce charge which
drove the American and French forces into headlong retreat
and caused the Allies to lift their siege of the British
troops in the city. Ensign Johnson&rsquo;s erstwhile comrade-in-arms,
John Christie, fought gallantly in 1780 at Mobile in
a futile effort to beat off a Spanish attack on that port. Christie
thereby redeemed his reputation which had been badly
tarnished by his premature surrender to the Indians when
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
he was in command of a fort at present-day Erie, Pennsylvania,
in 1763.</i></p>
<p><i>Many changes took place at Michilimackinac after 1772,
so many, in fact, that John Askin, an old-time resident, in
1778 wrote to Thomas McMurray, apparently the former
acting sergeant-major who had retired to a business in Montreal,
that he would scarcely recognize the post any more.
In place of the drafty old houses, such as the ones Morison
had lived in, the people, Askin reported, were &ldquo;now building
tolerable good ones.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><i>The fort also had a new surgeon&rsquo;s mate&mdash;another Scotsman,
David Mitchell. Unlike his compatriot Morison, Mitchell
adjusted very well to the rough conditions of life on the
fur-trading frontier. He married a Chippewa woman, and
when his regiment was transferred elsewhere he received
special permission to stay on as surgeon&rsquo;s mate so that his
wife would not be separated from her people. He remained
in the area in various capacities until his death in 1830. By
then old Fort Michilimackinac had been abandoned for a
half century and only a few ruins sticking out of the sand
reminded the occasional visitor of the colorful days of the
1760&rsquo;s and 1770&rsquo;s.</i></p>

<p><i><b><span class="xlarge">H</span></b>istorians recently discovered in the Frederick Haldimand

<p><i>The Memorial of Daniel Morrison Humbly Sheweth That your
Excellency&rsquo;s Memorialist was appointed surgeon to six independent
Companies raised in Scotland in the Year 1746, and reduced
in two Years thereafter, That in the year following he
was appointed surgeon&rsquo;s Mate to Lord Loudon&rsquo;s Highland Regiment
soon afterwards reduced; That in the year 1757 he came
to America as Mate to Lieut. Colonel Frasor&rsquo;s Regt. That during
the Winter 1760, he Passed an examination as surgeon, and
received that appointment to the 35th Regiment from His Excellency
General Murray, which the then Commander in Chief
did not confirm, That at the reduction of the 78th Regiment of
Foot he was appointed surgeon&rsquo;s mate to the 2d Battallion of
the 60th Regiment in which he had the Honor to serve untill the
Regiment was ordered for the West Indies where he Could not
attend them, on account of His health And that during the
Blockade of this City in 1775 he carried Arms, which extraordinary
last Fatigue reduced his health and strength still lower.
He now most humbly Pray Your Excellency&rsquo;s attention to the
length and nature of his Services, and to his advanced time of
life, and that you will be pleased to honour him with some
marke of your Favour, and your Memorialist as in duty bound
Shall ever pray&mdash;DAN MORISON SURGEON</i></p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
